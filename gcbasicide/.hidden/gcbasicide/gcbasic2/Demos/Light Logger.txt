'By default, this program will take a reading every second from port AN0, and write it
'to EEPROM. Most programmers have an "Read Chip" option, which can be used to upload the
'log to a PC.

'Program options
#define ReadWait 1 s 	'Read every 1 second
#define ReadSensor AN0	'Read the sensor on port AN0

'Hardware settings
#chip 16F819, 20 	'PIC 16F819 running at 20 MHz
#config MCLRE_OFF	'Turn off MCLR. WDT and LVP disabled and HS OSC selected automatically
#mem 256 		'Chip has 256 bytes of ram

'Initialise
DataCount = 0		'Set the EEPROM data location to 0
dir PORTA.0 IN		'Set the pin used for A/D conversion to an input

'Main routine

 if DataCount = 255 then end		'Stop program when EEPROM is full
 DataCount += 1				'Increment EEPROM location
